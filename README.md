Hello there!

Yes, I'm yet another autistic transfem graduate game developer/designer. Very stereotypical, I know.

I've recently completed an MSc Computer Games degree at the University of Essex, earning a Distinction grade.

I use she/her and zhe/purr pronouns.

I have a decent understanding of Java, Python, C#, and Unity.
I have experience developing for PC and mobile, and have experience with cross-platform multiplayer development.

My postgraduate dissertation project was [*CrabFight*](https://11belowstudio.itch.io/crabfight),
a Game-With-A-Purpose to evaluate the impact of environment complexity on animals living in the ecoystem,
through the medium of online multiplayer crab-based PvP combat,
using 3d photogrammetry models of real marine environments.
I have since been employed to continue working on this game for Natural England,
now branded as *CLAWS*. This game has successfully been exhibited at
[several](https://twitter.com/NENorfolkSufflk/status/1626503567224844288)
[public](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/lincolnshire-summer-fun-to-celebrate-kings-england-coast-path)
[events](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7114586412238135296/);
the latter of which was enabled via handover documentation I have produced,
which has successfully allowed them to run the game at events themselves.

I have also been employed to produce a variation of the game, called *CrabFind* - 
a more edutainment-y digital archaeology-oriented game, developed for the Isle of Man Museum,
using some 3D models of shipwrecks off the coast of the Isle of Man.
This game was successfully exhibited at the [Isle of Man Festival of the Sea](https://twitter.com/MorrisLeigh/status/1679987276678397956)
(July 2023).

Some of these repositories are repositories for the work I did during my degrees,
some of these repositories are for games and other things
I bodged together when I had some downtime, so a bit of a mixed bag overall.

Hopefully there's something in here that you won't completely dislike.

If you want to see the playable versions of my games, however, you can download them from my itch.io page, here: https://11belowstudio.itch.io/
They're all free (and several are playable via browser), so have fun.
