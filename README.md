I suppose this counts as an 'about me' page.

I'm a MSc Computer Games student at the University of Essex, currently bogged down with assignments,
but I suppose that I'll get this readme refined at some point.

I use she/they pronouns.

I have a decent understanding of Java, Python, and Unity.

Currently finishing up my postgraduate dissertation: developing [*CrabFight*](https://11belowstudio.itch.io/crabfight), a Game-With-A-Purpose to evaluate the impact of environment complexity on animals living in the ecoystem, through the medium of online multiplayer crab-based PvP combat.

Some of these repositories are repositories for the work I did during my undergrad
degree and masters degree, some of these repositories are for games and other things
I bodged together when I had some downtime, so a bit of a mixed bag overall.

Hopefully there's something in here that you won't completely dislike.

If you want to see the playable versions of my games, however, you can download them from my itch.io page, here: https://11belowstudio.itch.io/
