I suppose this counts as an 'about me' page.

Yes, I'm yet another autistic transfem game developer with depression. Very stereotypical, I know.

I've recently completed an MSc Computer Games degree at the University of Essex, earning a Distinction grade.
Still a bit burnt-out from it, but I suppose that I'll get this readme refined at some point.

I use she/her and zhe/purr pronouns.

I have a decent understanding of Java, Python, C#, and Unity.

My postgraduate dissertation project was [*CrabFight*](https://11belowstudio.itch.io/crabfight), a Game-With-A-Purpose to evaluate the impact of environment complexity on animals living in the ecoystem, through the medium of online multiplayer crab-based PvP combat.

Some of these repositories are repositories for the work I did during my undergrad
degree and masters degree, some of these repositories are for games and other things
I bodged together when I had some downtime, so a bit of a mixed bag overall.

Hopefully there's something in here that you won't completely dislike.

If you want to see the playable versions of my games, however, you can download them from my itch.io page, here: https://11belowstudio.itch.io/
