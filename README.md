I suppose this counts as an 'about me' page.

I'm a MSc Computer Games student at the University of Essex, currently bogged down with assignments,
but I suppose that I'll get this readme refined at some point.

I use she/they pronouns.

I have a decent understanding of Java, Python, and Unity.
Currently studying how to develop applications for Android, and how to perform data science
using Python.

Some of these repositories are repositories for the work I did during my undergrad
degree and masters degree, some of these repositories are for games and other things
I bodged together when I had some downtime, so a bit of a mixed bag overall.

Hopefully there's something in here that you won't completely dislike.
